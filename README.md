# Virtual_Personal_Assistant
      A Virtual Personal Assistant is one which helps user by doing their tasks they had told to do.As you all know it is like a google assistant ,apple siri or microsoft cortona.Triangle is an open source VPA,that anyone can use and modify it according to their needs.
      
# About the project
      This project has been initially developed as for our Bachelors final year project.Later we decided to move them into open source to continuosly add features,fix bugs and improve the quality of the personal assistant.Your contributions are always welcome.
      
# Moto of the Project
      While developing,we had decided to create a VPA that will implement the missing features that are all expected by the daily pc users.It doesnt mean it lacks the existing features,it is also there.
      
# Whats new?
      *Now you can order products from online e-commerce sites just by telling to our VPA.
      Eg: Buy me a jean from myntra.
      *Imagine a folder contains 1000000s of files with different formats and you want to split files under seperate folder based on the format of the file,you can do this by just telling our VPA,it will done within seconds.
      *Search for a file faster than ever we store files datapath in a databse so that whenver the user tells the VPA to search for a file,rather than checking through entire pc it will look up for the table.
      *Our VPA is capable of detecting in what pictures you are present and can copy to the specified location.
      *Object detection in a image is done in our pc.
